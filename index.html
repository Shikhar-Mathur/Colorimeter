                        A colorimeter is an instrument that analyses the amount of light getting through a solution with the amount that can get through a sample of pure solvents.
            <br>
            <br>
            A colorimeter makes use of a photocell that can measure the amount of light that enters the solution being tested. The amount of light that strikes the photocell after passing through the coloured solution determines the current that is produced. Thus higher the concentration of a solution, higher will be the absorbance of light

                   The working principle of the colorimeter is based on Beer-Lambert’s law which states that the amount of light absorbed by a color solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution and the length of a light path through the solution.

                A ∝ cl

                <br>
                Where, <br>

            A = Absorbance / Optical density of solution <br>

             c = Concentration of solution <br>

              l = Path length

             <ul>
            <li>Calibrate the colorimeter using a standard solutions of the known concentration of the solute that has to be determined in the test solution. Take the standard solution in cuvette and place in the cuvette holder in the colorimeter. Set the device at the desired wavelength and drop the OD reading to zero.</li> <br>
            <li>Once the device is calibrated, take the samples one by one in the cuvette and note down the optical density. </li> <br> 
            <li>In order to conduct the assay, a beam of light with a certain wavelength is pointed at the test solution. It goes through several lenses and filters before it gets to the test solution. The lens aids in the precise navigation of the light beam. The filters divide the incoming light into its constituent wavelengths, allowing the desired wavelength to pass through and reach the test solution-containing cuvette.</li> <br>
            <li>When monochromatic light (light with a single wavelength) enters the test solutions, some of it is reflected, some is absorbed, and the remainder passes through the test solution and lands on the photodetector. The galvanometer receives the pulses from the photodetector. The detector's electrical impulses are read by the galvanometer, which then digitally displays them. The reading is in line with the optical density or absorbance of the test solution.</li><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>The instrument is very sensate hence it should not experience abrupt changes in the environment. For instance, it's best to avoid flashing ambient light while taking the measurement.</li> <br>
                    <li>This instrument should not be used in a humid atmosphere or near water mist because it is not waterproof.</li> <br>
                    <li>The cuvette should be wiped to remove fingerprints and any other liquid droplets on the cover to avoid hindrance in the OD readings.</li> <br>
                    <li>The device must be calibrated prior to usage.</li><br>
